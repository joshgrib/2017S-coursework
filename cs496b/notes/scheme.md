# Scheme

## Functional languages
* **Programs are expressions.** When you "execute" the program, you are evaluating the expression.
* Expressions are **typed**, but **not statically**. This can be good and bad, often depending on the case. The benefit is that you get a little more freedom in the language, and the downside being that you can run into errors at runtime that you can't check when compiling
