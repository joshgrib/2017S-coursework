# CS 496 - Programming Languages

## Eduardo Bonelli
* ebonelli@stevens.edu
* Office hours TF 5-7pm Lieb 304
* Out for medical leave(surgery) soon
* Cool accent

## The course
* NOT about iterpreters, more about designing the language itself
* Scheme now, might be ocaml or haskell, might not though
* Assignment 1 available now (due next Friday), 2 will be up after that, and due
    in 2 weeks
* **Advice:** get familiar with scheme, 135 knowledge is probably not enough
* **Emailing:** Subject: Josh Gribbon CS496 ProgLang

### Grading
* 2pts off for every hour past deadline
* 0 is code does not compile
    * often graded significantly after deadline, strict rule
* 30% HW, 10% quizzes, 20% each - midterm, endterm, final

### Quizzes
* Typically on Wednesdays
* 0 if absent, absences are allowed with notice and good reason
* 2 copies given - one to hand in and one for feedback/notes during review

### Tests
* Midterm and endterm exams (dates on canvas)
* Final with is optional if your average is over 90

### Using an interpreter as a way to learn a PL(programming language)
Making an interpreter covers the bases with defining the langauge, the concepts
required to execute it, and the parsing and stuff like that

### Concept overview
* Expressions
* Functional programming
* Imperitive programming
    * functional programming + side effects - ex: variables/state - not in FP
* Object oriented programming

### Type inference/ type checking (random rant?)
* Checking - is what was passed an int, as expected?
* Iinference - whats the type of this thing? - way harder and not always possible

### Our PL - Racket
Good for the learning, but no static types, and so many parenthesis
|-->Maybe moving to a more modern lang (ocaml, haskell), but probably not this course

#TODO:

[ ] Check out assignment 1
[ ] Find *Essentials of Programming Languages* book online
    * Find other "additional texts", including the MIT 1984 one("a classic")
[ ] Set up markdown notes system
