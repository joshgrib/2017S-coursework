# LET Language Part 2 - Interpreter, Environments

## Environments
We need to know types and values of variables in order to evaluate expressions.

We'll create the function `value-of`, which when given an environment and expression, it will evaluate the expression and return an `ExpVal`. `ExpVal` is the set of types supported by the language, and thus able to be returned.
