# Scheme

## Functional languages
* **Programs are expressions.** When you "execute" the program, you are evaluating the expression.
* Expressions are **typed**, but **not statically**. This can be good and bad, often depending on the case. The benefit is that you get a little more freedom in the language, and the downside being that you can run into errors at runtime that you can't check when compiling

## Misc stuff
* **Currying** is the process (maybe only in haskell and not scheme) where a function that takes multiple arguments is converting into a function that takes one argument, and returns a function that can take the next argument, eventually returning a Value

## Scheme demo
See `20170120_intro.rkt` for the file containing demo stuff we did in class to explore the language
