# PROC
A language built on top of LET, that is able to make procedures

**The main thing being changed is essentially adding `clos` to the set on expressed values, `ExpVal`, which previously just had `num` and `bool`**

`clos` is a **closure**, a tuple including the formal parameters and the body of the function.

**Additionally**, we must pass in the relevant variables in that scope, as they may be referenced in the function.

```racket
(define-datatype clos clos?
    (closure
        (var symbol?)
        (body expression?)
        (saved-env environment?)))
