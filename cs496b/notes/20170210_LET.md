# LET Language part 2

## Quiz
### 1
With the grammer:
```
<BTree> ::= <number>
         |  (<BTree> <BTree>)
```
Write the derivation to show `(2 (3 4))` is a `BTree`.

**Answer**
```
Rule 1: <BTree> -> <number>
Rule 2: <BTree> -> (<BTree> <BTree>)
Rule 3: <number> -> a number
<BTree>
    Rule 2
(<BTree> <BTree>)
    Rule 1
(<number> <BTree>)
    Rule 3
(2 <BTree>)
    Rule 2
(2 (<BTree> <BTree>))
    Rule 1
(2 (<number> <BTree>))
    Rule 3
(2 (3 <BTree>))
    Rule 1
(2 (3 <number>))
    Rule 3
(2 (3 4))
```

### 2
We have the following encoding:
```racket
(define-datatype BTree BTree?
    (leaf-t
        (data number?))
    (node-t
        (left BTree?)
        (right BTree?)))
```

#### a
Write function `isNode` that returns true unless the tree is a leaf.

**Answer**
```racket
(define (isNode bt)
    (cases bt
        (leaf-t (n) #f)
        (node-t (lt rt) #t)))
```

#### b
Write `prettyPrint` that takes a tree and prints it out like `(2 (3 4))`
You can use `(number->string n)` and `(string-append str [str str ...])` functions.

**Answer:**
```racket
(define (prettyPrint bt)
    (cases bt
        (leaf-t (n)
            (number->string n))
        (node-t (lt rt)
            (string-append
                "("
                (prettyPrint lt)
                " "
                (prettyPrint rt)
                ")"))))
```

## Lecture
**So far:** we have a concrete and abstract syntax for ==The LET Language==.
