**For next week:**
If you can't get working code, explain what went wrong well and you'll get an 85. That means show attempts, explain thinking, test cases, etc.

For presentation
* Rubric on canvas, same as CS 146
* Split up speaking evenly
* Speak slowly, clearly, loudly
* Make eye contact with someone for a few seconds, then move on
