# Integers

## One-minute review of last week
### Bits and Bytes
**Everything is bits** - computers interpret them as numbers, instructions, characters, etc based on conventions
**General boolean algebra** applies boolean operators (OR, AND, XOR, NOT) as bitwise operators(|, &, ^, ~), different than boolean operators(||, &&, !)

## Encoding Integers
C-style `short` is 2 bytes long
Decimal|Hex|Binary
--|--|--
15213|3b 6D|00111011 01101101
-15213|C4 93|11000100 10010011

### Sign bit
For 2's complement, the most significant bit indicates sign, 0 for nonnegative, 1 for negative

### Numeric Ranges
**Unsigned values**
$UMin=0$
`00000000`
$UMax=2^{w}-1$
`11111111`

**Two's Complement values**
$TMin=-2^{w-1}$
`10000000`
$TMax=2^{w-1}-1$
`01111111`

**Other values**
Minus 1 = `11111111`

## Casting
By default **constants are signed ints**, and are unsigned if they have the `U` suffix such as `1234U`

If there is a mix of signed and unsigned numbers in an expression, **signed values are implicitly cast to be unsigned**

### Casting signed $\Leftrightarrow$ unsigned basic rules
1. Bit pattern is maintained, but reinterpreted
2. Can have unexpected side effect: adding or subtracting $2^w$
3. With signed and unsigned ints in an expression, **int is cast to unsigned**

## Expansion and truncation
When adding bits to a number, **the left side is padded with the value of the left-most digit**. To go from 4 to 8, `0011` becomes `00000011`, while `1001` becomes `11111001`.

##Basic rules
**Expanding**(e.g. `short int` to `int`)
1. Unsigned: zeros added
2. Signed: sign extension
3. Both yield  expected result

**Truncating**
1. Unsigned/signed: bits are truncated
2. Result interpreted
3. Unsigned: mod operation
4. Signed: similar to mod
5. For small numbers yields expected behavior

## Addition, negation, multiplication, shifting

### Addition
Overflow can happen positively negatively or both depending on types

### Multiplication
Often you need to put the result into a larger data type. If there is not a larger option than a custom solution or library is needed to accommodate the bigger numbers.

### Shifting
Shifting to the left once with multiply by 2
`u<<k` = $u*2^{k}$

Shifting to the right once with divide by 2(floor div.).
`u>>k` = $\lfloor{u/2^{k}}\rfloor$

### Arithmetic: Basic Rules
**Addition**
1. Unsigned/signed - normal addition followed by truncate, same operation on bit level
2. Unsigned - addition mod $2^w$
    * Mathematical addition and possible subtraction of $2^w$
3. Signed - modified addition mod $2^w$(result in proper range)
    * Mathematical addition and possible addition or subtraction of $2^w$

**Multiplication**
1. Unsigned/signed - normal multiplication followed by truncate, same operation on bit level
2. Unsigned - multiplication mod $2^w$
3. Signed - modified multiplication mod $2^w$ (result in proper range)

## Machine "Words"
Any computer has a **word size** that is the nominal size of integer data.
