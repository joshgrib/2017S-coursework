# Course overview

## Course theme
**Abstraction is good, but don't forget reality**

Most CS courses emphasize abstraction (abstract data types, asymptotic analysis - complexity calc).
That has limits, especially when bugs come up, and you need to understand the details of the implementation.

### Useful outcomes
* Become more **effective** programmers - find bugs efficiently, understand and tune programs for performance
* Prepare for later classes that deal with "systems" work (compilers, OSs, networking, architecture, embedded systems, etc)

## 5 Great realities

### 1 - `Int`s are not integers, `Float`s are not reals
In math, $x^2 \geq 0$, but with `int`s, there can be an overflow error

Sometimes grouping matters, $(a+b)+c \neq a+(b+c)$ sometimes

#### Computer arithmetic
* Does not generate radnom values
* Cannot handle/assume all "usual" mathemetical properties
    >That works in theory, but what about in practice?

### 2 - You've got to know assembly
* Pretty much nobody actually does assembly work anymore, but **understanding assembly is key to machine-level exeution**
* When you need to scale you need to understand what and where your limitations are and how you might get around issues
* Bugs can be rooted at a low level quirk
* Malware can often utilize low-level things

### 3 - Memory matters
**Random Access Memory is an unphysical abstraction**
* Memory is not unbounded
* Memory referencing bugs are especially harmful, with effects being distant in time and space
* Memory performance is not uniform - different methods of memory can have huge effects

```c
typedef struct {
    int a[2];
    double d;
    struct_t;
}
double fun(int i) {
    volatile struct_t s;
    s.d = 3.14;
    s.a[i] = 1073741824; /* Possibly out of bounds */
    return s.d;
}
```
Call|Value|Note
:--|:--|:--
fun(0)|3.14|Normal
fun(1)|3.14|Normal
fun(2)|3.1399998664856|Normally an out-of-bounds reference error
fun(3)|2.00000061035156| More issues
fun(4)|3.14|Maybe it works out again sometimes
fun(6)|Segmentation Fault|Ultimately will cause problems

Here we see that within the `struct`, `a` should hold 2 ints, but we can try and get values from other spots, they just won't be good values

### 4 - There's more to performance that asymptotic complexity

The system itself can affect performance, and you can work with it or against it

### 5 - Computers do more tha execute programs

* They need to get data in and out
    * I/O system i scritical to reliability and performance
* They communicate with each other over networks
    * This causes a lot of problems

## Course perspective

Most systems courses are **builder-centric** in that they focus on building something at a low level and understanding it

We will be more **programmer-centric** by showing how learning about an underlying systems makes you more effective
* More reliable and efficient code
* Get more power and using the OS

## Academic integrity
Cheating
* Sharing code
* Describing code to someone
* Helping someone line-by-line
* Searching web for solutions
* Copying old submissions

Not cheating
* Explaining how to use systems and tools
* Helping with high-level design issues

## Books
[The C Programming Language](http://alvand.basu.ac.ir/~dezfoulian/files/Programming/Prentice%20Hall%20-%20The%20C%20Programming%20Language-%20Brian%20W.%20Kernighan,%20Dennis%20M.%20Ritchie,%202nd%20ed.,%20ISBN%20.pdf)

## Getting Help
* Canvas
* Slack
* Gradescope - for submitting assignments
* CA office hours
    * W4-6pm Lieb lounge
    * F3-5pm Lieb lounge

## Lateness
**5 grace days for lateness** for the whole semester. Limit of 2 per assignment, and used automatically.

After grace days are used up, then **15% is lost per day late**, and **no sobmissions more than 3 days late**.
