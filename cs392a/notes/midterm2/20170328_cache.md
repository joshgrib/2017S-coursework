**Cache simulator assignment**
Write a cache simulator based on traces from valgrind.

I - instruction load - we're not doing this one
M - modify - read change write
L - load - read
S - store - write

Ignore the size, just focus on the addresses

**Parsing**
fgets()
I -> ignore
M,L,S -> sscanf
"%c, %&x, %d" - i think that's what he wrote

**Implementation**
Cache could be implemented as an array of structs, each having an address and data

Hit = successful access
Miss = nothing in cache
Eviction = a miss where you need to remove an entry and replace it

*Our eviction strategy* = [least recently used](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Least_Recently_Used_.28LRU.29)

**Overview**
Read lines
Store things
Record hits, misses, evictions

# Linking

## Static Linking
Compile program files separately, then combine them into one executable.

**Why Linkers?**
1. Modularity - write program as a collection of small source files, build libraries of common functions
2. Efficiency
    * Time - separate compilation of files, one change doesn't mean the whole thing needs to be compiled again
    * Space - libraries allow common functions to be stores together and remove duplicated code

## What do linkers do?
### Step 1 - Symbol resolution
* Programs define and reference symbols, which are global variables and functions
* Symbol definitions are stores in the object file by the assembler in the *symbol table*
    * The symbol table is an array of structs, with each having a name, size, and location

### Step 2 - Relocation
* Merge separate code/data sections into single sections
* Relocate symbols from relative locations in `.o` files to final absolute memory locations in the executable

## 3 kinds of object files (modules)
* **Relocatable object file (`.o`)**
    * Code and data to be combined with other relocatable object files to form the executable. Each `.o` file comes from exactly one `.c` file.
* **Executable object file (`.out`)**
    * Code and data to be copied to memory and then executed
* **Shared object file (`.so`)**
    * Special relocatable to be loaded into memory and linked dynamically at load or run time
    * `.dll` in Windows

## Executable and Linkable Format (ELF)
* Standard binary format for object files
* One format for all 3 kinds of object files
* "ELF Binaries"

### Format
* Elf Header - word size, byte ordering, file types, machine type, etc
* Segment header table - page size, virtual address memory segments(sections), segment sizes
* `.text` section - code
* `.rodata` section - read only data: jump tables, ...
* `.data` section - initialized global variables
* `.bss` section - uninitialized global variables, has section header but occupies no space
* `.symtab` section - symbol table, procedure and static variable names, section names and locations
* `.rel.text` section - relocation info for `.text` section, addresses of instruction that will ned to be modified in the merged executable
* `.rel.data` section - relocation info for `.data` section, addresses of pinter data that will need to be modified in the merged executable
* `.debug` section - info for symbolic debugging
* Section header table - offsets and sizes of each section

## Linker Symbols
* **Global symbols** are locally defined in a file, without `static` keyword
* **External symbols** - defined in one file and used in another
* **Local symbols** - uses `static` keyword, only used in file it is defined in
