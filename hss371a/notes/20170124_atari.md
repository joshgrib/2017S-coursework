# Atari, Missile Command, and the Cold War
**Atari** is an old video game company, and although their tech isn't relevant anymore they're still culturally significant.

## Magnavox Odyssey (1972)
* Ralph Baer - most lone inventor stories aren't true but he kinda is
* *Table Tennis* - basically Pong but not totally - no score keeping, controls were weird(it always hit the paddle and went straight)

## Atari(1972)
* Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney - stole the table tennis idea and created Pong
    > These guys basically marked the beginning of the cool environment around Silicon Valley even today, offering perks to get better output (Beer on fridays, pot all the time (big weed culture), very much a "boys club")
* **Pong** had score keeping and improved movement
    * Made with discrete circuitry, actually wiring the game to "program" it
* Ted got pushed out, Nolan became the CEO, also started Chucky Cheese

## Arcades
* Atari *started* the arcade industry through Pong, then they developed a culture of their own
* The culture was about the people there and how they interracted, *but also how people percieved the culture*. Arcades were seen as places kids would go to waste time and get into trouble with no parents around. (**Youth counterculture**)
> "What are we teaching kids these days? These games are full of violence" etc

## Consoles
* Fairchild Channel F(1976)
* Atari VCS (2600) (1977)
* Mattel Intellivision (1980)

## Warner Communications (Warner Bros)
**Atari needed some funding**
* 1972 - $500 initial capital
* 1976 - $28M - sold to Warner
* 1980 - $415M - gross income
* 1983 - $536M - losses

> The culture clash from Atari(smoking weed in a hottub) and Warner (suits and business)

### Incredible growth
Before Groupon(who cheated and "cooked the books"), Atari was teh fastest growing company **EVER**

### Incredibel collapse
Along with being the fastest growing, they were also one of the fastest collapsing

### The silicon valley VC culture
This was also the start of the whole thing were silicon valley is the place to go to get tons of funding for whatever you want

> Silicon Valley and Boston became major tech hubs that you need to talk about in the history of computing. These palces defined the tech itself but also the culture. For example the whole "data should be freely available and used for anything" is a concept that came mainly from this time period

## 1980 - Discrete cicuitry ==> CPUs
**Video games are a bigger industry than film.** Even today "video games" have the market penetration of being available (today) literally anywhere from phones, and it's there 24/7. Music has a similar penetration but isn't as profitable.

**A combined culture rise and leap in technology** led to huge adoption and advancement in the field. As a parallel today - you can only make Couterstrike look *so good*, so now we're moving into immersive gaming to get that next jump.

### 1980: Pac-Man
* Hedge mazes/ corn mazes/ labyrinths ==> Pac-Man (1980) - became the top game, still very culturally relevant
* Dungeons & Dragons (1974)
    * *Statanic Panic* during the Reagan era was a fear of D&D turning kids into Satan worshippers
* Adventure (1976) ==> Zork (1977)
* Maze (1073) ==> Maze War (1979)
* Wolfenstein 3D (1992) ==> Doom (1993)
* Dance Dance Revolution (1998)
* Galaga ==> Galaxian
* Space Invaders (biggest before PacMan)
* Donkey Kong
* Centipede
* Pole Position (first modern-viewpoint driving game, all top-down before)

## 1980: Missile Command
The big **fear during the Cold War in nuclear holocaust**. *War Games*(1982) also played on this cultural hot-spot through a kid hacking in and almost launching missiles at the soviety union. This brought to the forefront that not only could something awful like that happen on purpose, but also accidentally or at least not on truly on behalf of the countries.
* Created by Dave Theurer - awesome game developer
    * Cities in the game originally had names on California cities
* Bombers --> Nike Ajax Installations
    * Created to intercept Bombers
    * By the time they were finished they were outdated. **This is a recurring theme**.
* Multiple Impact Re-entry Vehicles (ICBMs) ==> NORAD
    * We made anti-ICMBs to shoot down the missiles (which is basically shooting a flying bullet with another bullet)
    * In response to anti-ICBMs, we both made missiles that split up into multiple missiles (Reagan started *Star Wars* to make lazers to shoot missiles down)
* "The End" - there is no way to win Missile Command(you just lose and see "The End"), just like the conclusion of *War Games*, "The only way to win is to not play"

## Cold War (1947-1991)
**Space race** caused a HUGE advancement in science and technology by racing to get to the moon. We were the second coutry to get into space and to orbit, so we felt like we were losing our technological edge, so multiple administrations poured money into the problem.

**Arms race** also caused huge advancements. If we have bombers then they'll have missiles, so we make bombs without planes, so they shoot them down, so now the missiles split up, so now we're going to make a space ship that will shoot lasers at the missiles... on and on...

### Eisenhower
Eisenhower fought in WW2, elected as a "military man turned president". **Even with all this money Eisenhower still had balanced budgets.** We spent money differently then, but Eisenhower started the trend of spending tons of money on secret projects that would protect the US
* Project Lightning(1956) - $25M
    * Spent to make a single computer for the NSA to break cryptographer
    * "We need a computer 100x better than now, in 2 years", "OK, here's 25 mil, go do it"
    * These "black hole projects" are things that money went into and no one could really know publicly how it's spent
* Advances Research Projects Agency - ARPA(1958) - $520M
    * ARPA-net is the foundation of the internet
    * Eisenhower - "We need to get an edge, so here's a blank check to a bunch of contractors, just go make some crazy stuff and try to help us"
    * This is why America more or less owns and hosts the internet
* Military Industrial Complex speech(1961)
    * Basically warning that we created this thing, and it's kinda hard to control. Our military is bigger than the 10 next combined or something, so we need to watch it.
    * The down side is that we spend a bunch of money
    * The good thing is that we have the coolest and best stuff

### *War Games* (1982)
* Mutually Assured Destruction

## Atari 1984
**Jack Tramiel**
* Concentration camp and holocuast survivor
* Created Commodore typewriter
* Buys Atari from Warner

# Discussion - Does immersive gaming and media pose a threat to society?

Inital idea: YES it *poses a threat*, but it doesn't necesarily need to end up like that.

## YES
* Trouble with moderation
* Rapid tech increase leads to vulnerability


## NO
* Unlikely to be more addictive
* Video games can be educational
* Outlet for vices
* Tech irrelevant , problems are just problems
* Alarmist

> Narrow-cast - the ooposite of broadcasting, kinda  aunique thing within the internet in that you get caught in your own narrow-cast echo-chamber
