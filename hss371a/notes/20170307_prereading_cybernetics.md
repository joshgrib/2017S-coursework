# Cybernetics

> Control through homeostasis rather than through domination gives the system greater flexibility and facilitated adaptation, Beer argued. He therefore proposed an alternative idea of control, which he defined as "a homeostatic machine for regulating itself."

I like the link here to habit formation. Managing yourself is definitely a complex system, so that's been my main lens for this. If you want to change the outcome of your system (your self) you need to focus on changing your homeostatis - the way you are by default.

> Mainframe computer technology entered the business world during the 1950s and 1960s, primarily as a means of increasing the speed and volume of data processing. Beer argued that most applications simply automated existing procedures and operations within the company instead of taking advantage of the new capabilities offered by computer technology to envision new forms of organization and better methods of management. Applied differently, computer technology could help organize the parts of the business into a better- functioning whole and allow companies to focus on the future instead of compiling pages of data that documented past performance. Computers did not need to reinforce existing management hierarchies and procedures; instead, they could bring about structural transformation within a company and help it form new communications channels, generate and exchange information dynamically, and decrease the time required for those in the company to make an informed decision. In short, Beer believed that computer technology, used differently, could help implement cybernetic approaches to management. 64 His focus was not on creating more advanced machines but rather on using existing computer technologies to develop more advanced systems of organization.

This was just a cool point that sometimes it's best not to just replace a process with a computer, but to totally redesign it to take advantage of the totally different abilities computers have.

>“I found that I had the small amount of power that I needed to do something
bigger.”

Quote from Flores on the plan to put plans into practice by bringing in Stafford Beer.

[Viabel System Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viable_system_model) - model made by Beer to represent any system capable of autonomy.

> The Liberty Machine modeled a sociotechnical system that functioned as a disseminated
network, not a hierarchy; it treated information, not authority, as the basis
for action, and operated in close to real time to facilitate instant decision making and
eschew bureaucratic protocols. Beer contended that this design promoted action over
bureaucratic practice and prevented top- down tyranny by creating a distributed network
of shared information.

Beer made data king and everything else has a role to play in relation to it. Different people need to make different decisions but ultimately they're based on data so you can remove a lot of the "fuzzy" decision making that would need to happen otherwise.


## Constricting the Liberty machine
Beer stressed to the team and others the structure and dynamic, as that's what he was trying to create.

CyberSyn had the lasting impact of British programmers teaching practicesof documentation and testing in development that weren't present before and stayed after.


>They held twice- weekly
seminars in which members of the team led discussions of economic theory, and they
started studying structuralist inflation models that linked inflation to insufficient production
levels rather than to an increase in the money supply.

This is just cool for transferring developing theories into code

>In their correspondence with Anderton the Chileans
now displayed a more nuanced understanding of the Chilean economy, and how to
model it, than their British mentor. For example, in September 1972 they identified
sixteen rules for modeling inflation specifically in the Chilean context.

So cool that they were able to find all these economic rules through the process of developing the model


> Something Anderton couldn’t know, but which was becoming increasingly clear to
those living in Santiago, was that the absence of investment, rather than its improper
use, was at the root of the problem. And the problem had been caused by the unseen
hand of the U.S. government. Decreases in foreign aid and foreign credit, the flight
of foreign capital, plummeting international demand for Chilean copper (which had
drastically cut the funds available for Chilean foreign trade), and the unwillingness of
106 Chapter 4
U.S. companies to sell machinery and spare parts to Chilean industries all contributed
to consumer shortages. Chilean industries had historically relied on imported machinery,
much of it from the United States, but the U.S. government had cut economic
aid to Chile from $80.8 million in 1969 to $3.8 million in 1973. 28 Moreover, the U.S.
government also put pressure on banks to cut credit to Chile.

Plot twist!

> For example, in 1970 the
U.S. Export- Import Bank dropped Chile to its lowest credit rating category. The level
of available short- term U.S. commercial credits dropped from $300 million during the
Frei government to $30 million in 1972. The U.S. Export- Import Bank itself cut credit
to Chile from $28.7 million in 1969 to $3.3 million in 1970 to zero in 1971. 29 The
inability to secure foreign credit forced the Allende government to pay for imports
using cash from its foreign exchange. This put the government in a difficult situation.
As mentioned earlier, wage increases from Allende’s income redistribution program
had created a dramatic increase in demand for many consumer goods. To meet this
demand, the government increased its importation of food, fuel, and other goods and,
in the process, quickly depleted Chile’s foreign exchange, which the government could
not replenish because of falling copper prices. While the economic policies put in place
by Popular Unity were in part responsible for this imbalance of supply and demand,
consumer shortages also stemmed from factors that were beyond the control of the
Chilean government, including the openly hostile stance the United States had taken
toward Chile.

Cool economy-talk
All around page 106


They made all this awesome progress, and then the main problem ended up being a lot of foreign influence. On top of that a lot of people wanted the Socialism "experiment" to fail.

The team (Beer included) concluded that they made some awesome and useful models for seeing the effect of different variables, but was not good for getting actual numbers to base decisions off of. Beer said "no one was anxious to place reliance on the results"


>Project Cybersyn needed to draw heavily on foreign expertise and imported technology.
But as the history of the CHECO project shows, Chileans could not simply imitate
the techniques used in more industrial nations. Chilean modelers could not follow
Anderton’s recommendations because Chile had different recordkeeping practices than
Britain and had less control over its domestic affairs due to U.S. attempts to set up the
overthrow of Allende.

Should the US really be doing all this stuff? I'm sure there was reasoning at the time, and to some extend we are "Team America World Police", but I feel like we should moreso be like "Hey UN, we have all this power, let's figure out how to use it".


The project technically failed but had a ton of things that became bigger concepts later one, and was still a huge accomplishment.

New and creative designs were created.


The modellers failed by not properly involving the factory workers in the planning stages
