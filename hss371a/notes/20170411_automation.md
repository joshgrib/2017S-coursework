Final is taken in class on the last week.

# The Second Machine Age
>"It's not even on our radar screen [because the AI issue will take] 50 or 100 more years." ~ Steve Mnuchin, US Treasury Secretary (2017)

>"In 50 years, this 18-month period we're in now will be seen as being crucial for the future of the AI community. It's when the AI community finally woke up and took itself seriously and though about what to do to make the future better. ~ Stewart Russell

## Labor
**Labor** - a relationship between expertise and an object

**Skilled labor** - vocational training or apprenticeship, not a college degree.

**Professional labor** - some baccalaureate program, meta-object - not learning how to *use* the object or interact with it, but more learning *about* the object and the properties it has

**Blue collar** - manual labor and skilled labor, often nostalgic for the past where blue collar jobs were more valued in society, at risk of being replaced by automation
* An object physically built or maintained.

**Pink collar** - service industry

### Unions
**All wealth is created by labor**. In capitalism *you need the labor* to *create* the wealth, which can be *refined* by management.

Because wealth is created by labor, people work a lot to get more wealth. In 1870 the avg workweek was 61 hours. People started to get the idea that they create wealth through their labor but don't get a fair share of it.

Results of unions:
* Weekends
* 8 hour days
* End of child labor
* Paid vacations
* Employer-based health coverage
* Parental leave
* Overtime and holiday pay
* Safety regulations

#### 1940s - 1950s
* Unionization is at it's highest
* Income inequality was at it's lowest (in US history)

#### Culture and identity
Outsourcing and automation took power away from the unions by using other sources of labor that they couldn't be competitive with.

[Elaine Purkey - One Day More](https://inzanetimes.wordpress.com/2011/06/01/one-day-more-against-work-without-rights/) Themes:
* Perserverance
* Collective
* "Honest people" victimized and just looking for basic rights
* Power = criminal

The current general culture of the U.S. "rust belt" is largely aligned with this, as a result of the loss of power to automation and globalization. This causes an **opposition to trade agreements** to try to keep jobs in the U.S. But automation remains a threat.

## Automation
* 1970 - Rise of the robots
* 1979 - Peak US manufacturing employment
    * The initial introduction of automation was accompanied by a rise in employment, but then a drop of the technology advanced

### White collar labor
**Managerial, administrative, and professional**

White collar labor *wasn't subject to the same pressured of blue collar labor*. Instead of systems being physically built or maintained, the focus of on **management of systems**.

There are however, still job loss as a result of technological advances for while collar labor too:
* Data input - lots of humans(usually women) just entering data into computers, replaced by scanning numbers
* Data processing - a "computing division" at a company would have humans(again usually women) who were "computers" with adding machines just doing a bunch of math, replaced by computers like the UNIVAC
* Word processing - secretaries used to listen to oration and write it down(many men didn't know how to type), replaced by the personal computer that removed the intermediary

Unions saw white collar job loss happening and tried to get established in offices, but it never caught on much.

Automation also caused a need for many people to be retrained for new jobs. Often this was done through training with computers, and the "**VDT**"(Video display terminal - computer screen) started to be resented.
* "Computers are ruining labor"
* "Work isn't as satisfying doing data input"
* "Progress isn't all it's cracked up to be"

**The culture of unionism was to take pride in your work**, and people had a hard time taking pride in doing data input type jobs. Additionally the lack of unions in offices remove protections union workers enjoyed.

## Newspapers and the internet
**Business model: control distribution**
* Advertiser access to eyeballs
* Scarcity in the marketplace

The internet uprooted this model by putting anyone with a website on the same level. You no longer needed all the infrastructure to produce and distribute the news

### 1985 - 2005
>The release of the Macintosh in 1984 marked a new ability of "desktop publishing". Beforehand newspapers would have to be laid out by hand, **literally cutting and pasting, extremely time consuming**. Now you can just do it easily, digitally, affordably.

* Increasing revenues
* Increasing profit
* Stable employment
* Increasing efficiency

#### Shifting technology
* Productivity gains
* Wages stagnate
* Benefits industry incumbents and shareholders

Technological improvements let newspapers be more profitable and work better without employing more people.

### 2005 - 2015
#### Shifting technology again
* Business model is still to control distribution
* **BUT** *the internet now made the distribution cost $0*
* New business models emerge, undermining how newspapers operate

**The addressable market is now the whole world**, and that's bad for industry incumbents. All newspapers now compete with every other news organization around the world, and also Buzzfeed, and Reddit, and anyone with a website.

* Subscriptions drop
* Employment drops

## A 21st Century Case Study - Advertising and Google
The "I'm Feeling Lucky" button

>"We want Google to be as smart as you, you should be getting an answer the minute you think of it." ~Sergey Brin (2011)

### Google 1998  -Weighter Search
Now search results are organized differently and align better to what we value as humans and what we're actually looking for. Google weighted based on *inbound links*, to look for evidence of value from other websites.

### Google 2017 - Applied Artificial Intelligence
The only way for Google to get you an answer *the moment* you think of it is to learn all the context of a life to find likely next questions.

* Translation - almost devoid of human interaction at this point, largely machine learning
* Voice and image recognition
* Contextual search

## Defining AI
* **Artificial General Intelligence** - a computer can do anything a human can do
* **Artifical Narrow Intelligence** - a computer can do anything a human can do, *within narrow bounds**
    * Google *AlphaGo* - vastly more complex from beating a human at Chess because there's so many more moves from any board state. AlphaGo can beat *anyone* at Go, but *no one* at chess

Cool thing about AlphaGo:
* Expanded by machine - algorithm improves itself
* Bounded by humans - the system knows how to get better at Go, but doesn't know what a game even is so it has no way of handling anything except Go

### Trends
* Progress in unclear
* Limitations are unclear
* The outcome is unclear

**However**, these are the same trends that existed for *Applied Logic*(350 BCE - 1948 ACE)
* Aristotle: *The Organon*
* Claude Shannon - *A Symbolic Analysis of Switching and Relay Circuits*

Information technology how continually been driven by advances with unknown outcomes.

### The Google Assistant
Applied Narrow Intelligence

PC --> Web --> Mobile --> AI

#### A problem for Google
Their business model is built of advertising, but the Assistant is voice, and AI, so they need to figure out how to put ads in there, and maintain the integrity of the algorithm while somehow allowing the influence of advertisers.

Narrow AI competitors:
* Voice - Siri and Alexa
* Data - Facebook, Amazon, Uber

General AI competition:
* How might this affect industry incumbents?
* How might this affect the workforce? What new groups could be displaced by general AI?
