**Midterm updates**
Due 3/21/2017 the week we get back from Spring Break

## Networking and Internet Pioneera
**Altavista**(1995)
The original good search engine. Google took them out by adding relevance based on links to pages from other pages.

**DEC**
1993 - First Fortune 500 company with a website
1993 - first department web server
1986 - First firewall
1985 - First computer company to register an internet domain
1985 - First corporate internet gateway and email
...they were awesome

>Right now Facebook
 and Google have 85% of internet revenue stuff, with different models
>   * Google wants open web so people use their engine and stuff
>   * Facebook is all internal on the site so they want to keep people on their site and off the rest of the web

### DEC - PDP-1 (1959)
There was "no money in computers" because IBM owned that market. They then make NOT a computer, but a "Personal Data Processor".
* First DEC computer
* ==User interaction comes before machine efficiency.== IBM was not focussing on being as user-friendly because they had support people. DEC wanted people to be able to handle it all on their own.
* First real video games written on PDP-1 - Spacewar (1962)
    * Mainframes had chess or tic-tac-toe
    * New mechanics with display screens and input devices for real-time control
    * Before the PDP, "computers"(usually mainframes) were big expensive and important, and no one was using them for games

### PDP-11 (1970)
* Program in hexadecimal with switches, 16-bit architecture
* Definitely fits on a desk now

### VAX-11 (1976)
VAX = Virtual Address eXtension
* A 32 bit system extended on the PDP-11
* ==Over 400,000 sold==, an enormous number

### Alpha $\alpha$ (1962)
* 64-bit systems

### Mainframes (IBM System/360)
* Centrally controlled
* Timeshared

### Minicomputers (DEC PDP/VAX)
* User controlled
* Interactive
* User shared (multiple login accounts)
* Terminal/server (vs. Client/Server)
    * Terminals allowed people to access the server remotely. No local processing or anything, not a computer, just a way to access the server

## Minicomputer era ends (~1985)
*Disruptive innovation*
Clayton Chistensen

**Keys for disruption:**
* A business model innovation
* A new commercial ecosystem
* A technological enabler

>Venture capital is particularly interesting for people because ==there is no cap on how much you can make, but you limit how much you can lose.== This also ties in to the desire for *disruption*, because that's the way to get the "big win" in venture capitalism.

As PCs got more and more powerful they began to overtake the bigger computer companies markets

### Minicomputers: Disruptive?
**DEC**
* Business model: low-cost computing
* New commercial ecosystem: labs and offices
* Technological enabler: small mainframes

### Minicomputers: Disrupted
**Technological enabler: Microprocessor**
==Microprocessors COMPLETELY changed the game with computers==
* Lowering complexity of building a computer
    * 1960s DEC & Data General: ~100 people
    * 1970s Commodore & Apple: ~10 people
* Minicomputer on a chip
    * Intel 286, Motorola 68020 (legendary microprocessors of the 80s)
        * Full 16-bit processors
        * protected memory
    * Still not as fast as DEC stuff so they survived a little longer

**Business model: Personal computers**
* DEC: $50,000 computer
* Apple: $2,000 computer
* Commodore: $500 computer

**Commercial ecosystem: Home and office**
* DEC: 1 computer per large office
* Apple: Every employee has a computer
* Commodore: Every home has a computer

## Supercomputers
Computing hierarchy
1. Supercomputers
2. Mainframes
3. ~~Minicomputers~~
4. PC
5. Tablets, phones, etc

### Univorsity if Illinois - Nathional Center for Supercomputing Applications
* Mosaic --> Netscape --> Firefox
* HTTPd
* ILLIAC (1951-197?)

#### ILLIAC IV (1964-1971)
Vietnam War going on 1954/1961 - 1975

**"Smash the ILLIAC IV"**
* Word spread about a new ILLIAC on campus, set to be the worlds best supercomputer
* Students saw this an an advancement of the military industrial complex onto campus
* They put up fliers and stuff in outrage

##### Final Installation
* High parallelism: 256 processors (vector processing)
* NASA Ames Research Center in CA
* ARPANet Connectivity in 1975 - first supercomputer for networked world

### IBM Stretch (1956 - 1961/2)
Named Stretch to be 100x faster than previous model (failed).

#### AEC's(Atomic Energy Commission) Los Alamos National Laboratory 1961
* High speed multiplication was attractive

#### NSA w/ *Harvest* 1961
* Programmatic flexibility for crytanalysis
* Manipulate great volumes of data
* Became the worlds first natural language processor

**Innovations**
* Look ahead (fetching, modifcation, and execution of instructions/data)
    * Gets info before branching to process quicker
* Interrupts (necessary for look ahead), what we use now for keyboard, mouse, etc
* Error checking (necessary for look ahead)
* 8-bit byte
* Huge memory: ~768 kilokytes = 3/4 megabyte

**Harvest**
* Stream processing unit: 3,000,000 characters per second
* Keyword search averaged 30k intercepted messages/minute
    * Messages could be ~500 chars
    * Keyword table of 7k phrases
    * ~7 million intercepted messages in 4 hours

**Tractor**
* Magnetic tape unit
* Automatic tape switching and searching
* 40 million characters = **40 GB**

**Rye**
* Remote login
* Harvest deciphering in the field, savings hours/days

#### Operation Shamrock 1947-1973
* Transatlantic cables delivered to NSA on magnetic tapes
* Lower Manhattan telecom companies (Western Union, RCA< ITT World Communications)

All communications would come in through Manhattan, and be copied to magnetic tapes by the telecom companies, then an NSA agent would come and pick up the tapes

#### Domestic expansion
Used for foreign/foreign, foreign/domestic, and domestic/domestic
* Beginning
    * We want to catch Mafia type of people (racketeering)
    * Expanded for Cuban/American communications during missile crisis
    * Expanded for narcotics trafficking in the 1960s and 1970s
    * A bunch of people started to be monitored without a warrant for pretty much no reason
* Eventually a watchlist was created of people to monitor for any reason

#### The numbers
* Annual communications
    * 24 million telegrams
    * 50 million telex messages
    * Billions of computer micro-transactions
* Approximately 150k/month selected for analysis, filtering based on keywords for people, phrases, places, sender, etc

#### Minaret 1969
* Totally without judicial oversight or legislative charter
    * No one really know except the agency and the president, and the president was often not told things so they'd have plausible deniability
* Specific communications of *civil rights*, *peace groups*, *military deserters*, *black power*, etc all monitored
* Plenty of random, even high-profile cultural heroes, all monitored
* Highest secret classification, because it was illegal

##### 1975 - Minaret program leaked to public
People get really pissed because they started looking at criminals and potential threats, but eventually spread to random people, athletes, and even congress. The NSA was even opening peoples mail, taking photos, and sealing again.

Nixon actually found out about just how much spying when we asked for more spying and found out we were already beyond what he asked for. Asked for postal snooping and found out it had been happening for like 18 years or something.

**The Church Committee** was a court case thing about all the illegal spying the government was doing on everyone, including citizens and politicians, led by Frank Church.

## Discussion
We have rules of war, should there be rules for how computers are used in war?

**YES**
* Power grid goes down --> people die
* Prevent tyrannical applications or unforeseeable futures with legislation now
* A "killswitch" to shut down communications or internet could be really bad
* Legislation protect the innocent
* Some rules are better than no rules
* Having the laws in place, even if they aren't followed 100%, will still be somewhat effective to discourage bad actions
* Prevent a financial war

**NO**
* Computers don't directly damage people
* Legislate source of issue, not the tool
* Legislations creates loopholes, and makes them justifiably legal
    * There's always ways around it
