### 20th century distribution of media
#### "Networked distribution"
* Big brands appeal to masses
* Candidates appeal to middle

Distribution is a HUGE thing to tackle when starting or running a company. Because distribution works better at a larger scale, there are typically very large companies handling the distribution network, with smaller companies that have a brand image, and a get distributed through the parent companies network.

### 21st century distribution
#### "Pull and push""

**Pull**
* Search is a "voiced aspiration", it shows something you want
* Driven by a *desire* or a *need*

**Push**
* Content that drives engagement - social media gives you a bunch of content you'll probably like, in order to keep you around
* Driven by *emotion* or *passion*

**Politicians** and **brands** can drive engagement if they aren't sitting  the middle.

>Before the internet, you needed a fairly large market in order to get enough business to survive. Now, however, **the internet have shifted the focus to engagement**. This is a change from when the focus was on getting someone just as a customer, VS an involved customer.

### Media types
1. Paid media: advertising
2. Earned media: news coverage, friend recoomendation

**NEW** - "Engaged media"

Schmudde made the term to talk about when people are interactive and want to be more interactive with the product.

### Internet media
* No distribution advantage
* Old gatekeeper commoditized - all news on facebook is just news, not necesarily associated with the network as much. Choosing a network and an anchor used to be a big deal, now it's not.
    * Facebook, twitter
    * Open web, forums, RSS, media aggregation sites

**To be a big news site today, you don't need to break news.** You just need to be the best place to go in some way(quantity, quality, etc).

## Part 2: Mediums
There's a lot of different ways to communicate. From speaking to painting to programming to turning a light on and off.

### *Media is an extension of man* - Marshall McLuhan
* Eliminate time and space factors
* Alter daily habits
* Therefore it steadily alters perception

These are the type of things that bother people about computers. They have totally altered the way we live life, especially in the idle moments.

### *The medium is the message* - Marshall McLuhan
* The message of any medium is the change of scale or pace or pattern
* Content of any medium is *always* another medium
    * telegraph
    * print
    * written word
    * speech
    * though

Any media is eventually going to resolve down to a thought or collection or thoughts. The true value of the internet is that it's the greatest collection of thoughts we've ever had access to.

In the past we would "go online", by connecting to the internet and making us available. Today we are more or less always connected by push notifications, or at least we always have access to it through the cell phone.

Having the phone in your pocket, buzzing for notifications, is a different way of living.

>Once we have surrendered our senses and nervous systems to the private manipulation of those who would try to benefit from taking a lease on our eyes and ears and nerves, we don't really have any rights left. Leasing our eyes and ears and nerves to commercial interests is like handing over the common speech to a private corporation, or like giving the earth's atmosphere to a company as a monopoly. (p.73 of the 1966 Signet paperback edition)
~Marshall McLuhan
**Example:** "I'm tired of talking and hearing about Trump". In a way he has leased out space in everyones personal lives.

## Part 3: The Internet

### Early networks
* AT&T/Telecommunications
* IBM/Mainframe computing

### Time-sharing
**Paul Baran** - *On Distributed Communication Networks*
* A paper written in 1964 talking about different types of networks, how to organize them, etc
* Three main types:
    1. Centralized - one central hub node with many connected nodes. Edge nodes can communicate, but through he hub node. The downside here is that there is one critical location.
    2. Decentralized - multiple hub nodes connected, with client nodes connected to the hubs.
    3. Distributed - Many nodes connected to adjacent nodes. No node is necessarily any more powerful than others.

### Early networks
* ARPANET - USA 1969
* Different names <> Different manufacturers

### ARPANET
* Node 1: UCLA
    * August
    * Scientific Data Systems (SDS) SIGMA 7
* Node 3: UCSB
    * Novembder
    * IBM 360/75

People wanted to network the machines so they could use either machine from remote locations for maximum use. BUT these are two different machines that aren't compatible.

#### The solution
Basically a router.
* Interface Massage Processor (IMP)
* Honeywell DDP-516 Mini computers
    * 12k memory
    * <= 50 kbps on AT&T lines

#### Protocol
January 1 1983
* The entire network was switched over the TCP/IP from ARPANET NCP
* This is the only time the internet was "reset". It didn't necessarily all happen at once.

The internet was actually so well designed that even though virtually every piece of it has been replaced multiple times, there has been pretty much no widespread downtime.

### The medium
* nodes - controlled by hosts
* edged - controlled by telecoms
* protocols
    * TCP/IP - open and insecure
    * Database language - open or closed
    * API - open or closed
        * Twitter became popular for its open API, giving everyone a lot of access to data
        * Facebook has a pretty closed API
        * Twitter has made the API more closed since gong public.
* flows - the combination of the nodes, edges, and protocols
    * flows can work very smoothly
    * flows can have, by accident or design, choke points that get in the way

**View of the medium**
* Nodes + edges = structural connections
* Protocols = rules of connectivity
* Flow = narrative

#### The message: Flow
Things we (probably) want in the flow
* Openness
    * Free information
    * Can twitter ban people? (ex: Milo)
* Reliability
    * We want consistent access
    * Turkey's internet went down suspiciously during protests
* Speed
    * Speed is good
    * Equal or tiered? Should there be different payment levels, should emergencies take precedence?
* Asynchronous
    * Texting/IM VS calling

#### Asynchonicity
* Time is an organizing principle in our lives
    * Share real-time events
    * Personal on-demand silos
* Lived
    * 1990s: desktop personal computer
    * 2010s: Ubiquitous mobile experience

We've always had time (changing season, day/night), but technology brought about more and more synchronous time. Railroads brought time zones, computers brought atomic clocks.

#### Example: politics
SOPA and PIPA were interesting debates, where the hosts were against it, and the telecoms were for it. Protocols can also have politics in the decisions regarding how they are defined.

#### Content: eMail (1972)
* Ray Tomlinson (BBN): multi-user, multi-computer messaging
* routed with `@`
* ~1975: 75% of the ARPANET traffic was email

#### Content: WWW (1989)
* Tim Berners-Lee (CERN): multi-computer publishing
* PC CLient/Server paradigm

#### The medium's affect
* Attitudes towaards IP
    * Open source
    * Piracy
    * Ownership
* Attitude towards surveillance
* Attitude towards cultural institutions
* Attitudes towards ownership and liability
    * Social identity
    * User-generated content
    * Cloud storage and personal archives

## Discussion
**Is fake news an inevitable byproduct of the current digital landscape?**

>**Fake news** - information presented as fact, that is misleading or false, either intentionally or not.

**YES**
* Free speech means people can say anything, including fake news. This is a problem with the people and not with the internet.
* Trolling - Poe's law - *without a clear indicator of the author's intent, it is impossible to create a parody of extreme views so obviously exaggerated that it cannot be mistaken by some readers or viewers as a sincere expression of the parodied views.*
* People like it
* Driven for clicks and views


**NO**
* Tabloid news has always been around
* People are lazy
* Can be stopped with policy
