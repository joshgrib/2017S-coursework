# The Road to the PC
>How do we get from mainframes and minicomputers to where we are now?

##  Early international systems
* Japan - Fujitsu FACOM M-100 (IBM System/370)
* East Germany - Robotron K 1840 (VAX-11/780)
* Soviet Union - ES EVM (IBM System/360)

There was a problem with other countries making clones and selling them through reverse engineering. IBM ended up just providing support for them because they didn't know what to do.

## Personal computers
**USA**
* Commodore PET - 1977 (MOS 6502)
* Apple II - 1977 (MOS 6502)
* Radio Shack TRS-80 - 1977 (Zilog Z80)
* Commodore 64 - 1982 (MOS 6502)

**Other countries**
* Even new computers were still using American architectures and some hardware

## Mid-century globalism
>USA is #1 is geopolitical- and market-manipulation

### Enablers
* Computer hardware standard
* Computer software spreads
* Ubiquitous air travel
* Electronic Bank transfer
* Satellite communication

### Corporate computers
*"The digital office"*
Mainframe: "Clergy"
Minicomputer: Engineer

The clergy for the mainframe were the people that were allowed to actually use it. If anyone else wanted to use it they would go through the clergy.

* Input
* Output - paper, terminal
* Communication - teleprinter, terminal
* Information processing - typewriters, adding machine/calculator
* Transmission - projectors, copy machine, telephone

## Case Study - Jack Tramiel
* Born 1928-12-13 in Lodz Poland

### WW2
* 1939-11-12: Nazi Germany annexes Lodz
* Makes Litzmannstadt ghetto for manufacturing textliles
* 1944-08: Moved to Auschwitz-Birkenau in Oswiecim Poland
* 1944-09: Moved to Neuengamme/Hannover-Stoken Germany
* 1944-11: Moved to Neuengamme/Hanover-Ahlem Germany
* 1945-05: Allies liberate Ahlem

**1945-1956**
Now Jack has to figure out what to do, he has education up to 4th grade, and experience as a slave laborer.

He goes from Germany --> USA, lands in New York, join the Army for 2 years, and he's trained to repair typewriters.

Almost goes to Korean War, then doesn't have to, gets typewriter repair shop. UN in Manhattan is going to sell a bunch of typewriters, he gets a loan with his army creds, repairs them, sells them, moves to Canada.

**1958** - Founds *Commodore Portable Typewriter Limited* in Canada. Gets a connection to import Chechoslovakian typewriters (behind the iron curtain), and is able to undercut competitors prices.

**1960** - Founds *Commodore Business Machines* (play on IBM), finds a way to import typewriters even cheaper. Being based out of Toronto, he can take advantage of Canada being part of the Commonwealth(old British countries), so he was able to import and ship easier to other Commonwealth countires, notably Australia and India.

### Commodore Electro-Mechanical Adding Machines
* 1962 - buys a West German adding machine factory - notable for being electric at the time
* 1965 - Imports Japanese adding machines after hearing they may try to undercut him.
* 1971 - sells four-function calculator with Japanese components
    > Calculators were moreso the first step to PCs than mainframes, having microprocessors

* 1974 - Sells scientific calculators with Japanese components
* 1976 - Buys MOS Technology Inc. of Norristown, Pennsylvania
    * MOS comes with the MOS 6502 processor, made in 1975
        * The MOS 6502 is used all over the place for decades, in the Apple II, PET, Commodore, Atari, Tamagotchi
        * Full features and inexpensive
        * Anyone could buy a chip
        * Everyone has access to documentation
        * $25 vs $300(Motorola competitor)
        * The designed had the vision of making it available to tons of people and make it easy for them to use
* 1977 - PET - the *FIRST* computer you can just take out of the box, plug in, and use, with the MOS 6502 at its heart

### Organizational Culture
Tramiel almost had an advantage by having to little formal education, because he didn't come in with any ideas of what a computer *should* be. All the mainframe manufacturers didn't see minicomputers coming. Minicomputer companies didn't see PCs coming. Each step opened up computer usage to more less-skilled people. Jack just thought everyone should use them, like a calculator.

Jack's Themes
* Individual use
* Individual empowerment
* Global marketplace: component cost determines what's next
    * This is the opposite of the current Silicon Valley-speak of *visions* and *political* or *social objective*. This was just looking at components costs, finding out how to get it cheaper or find an opportunity, and go with that. Example: VR has been "around the corner" for a few decades, but the price point and design aren't quite there yet.

## IBM PC
**1981**
* Release of Model 5150 - the origin of Windows, based on this architecture
* 62% of manframe market
* 60%(1970) - 32%(1980) of computer market

To come up with a different idea, they said "what would we do if we weren't IBM", and found a bunch of random cheap parts and put them together. **Because of making a product out of pieces anyone can get, people just made their own**. Then they got a ton of competitors and some are better.

**At the same time, Microsoft made a bunch of money by having IP that people needed**

## Cybernetics
>A trans-disciplinary approach to exploring regulatory systems. ~ Wikip

* Comes from the greek word for "to steer".
* For describing systems with goals.
* Invented by Norbert Weiner at MIT to solve the problem on aiming anti-aircraft guns and adjusting for missing.

This is the origin on the `cyber-` prefix for internet and computer stuff.

## Discussion - Is American domination of computer technology a net positive?
**YES**
* We live in America so good for here
* Interoperability would be way worse
* Having all programming in English is really convenient - common language allows exchange of ideas
* One location creates one standard of development > esp for hardware
* We had the resources and were willing to use them - manpower, $$$, organizational structures
* America is the melting pot - we have the diversity here, especially with post-war immigration, but immigration in general has always been good
    > This is a downside of immigration restrictions, we have good resources and education, and immigration leads to innovations in the US

* Having one main system helps make it more robust, especially for security


**NO**
* More perspectives makes a better system
* Tech has culture baked in, adding variety minimizes the impact of any one
* Testing is more diverse - more test cases, more use cases included in design
* Different systems = more diverse security research, people find different hacks and learn from each other. No one system is perfect so this would be good.
* Monopolies may be less prevalent
    * As an example of this happening now - different laws and cultures mean companies have to operate slightly differently in different places


### On "outdated" systems
There are benefits to old systems
* Poor documentation/ low usage means harder to hack
* Decades of testing
