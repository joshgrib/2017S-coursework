## "Mother of All Demos" - 1968
Presented by **Doug Englebart**, showing *the dawn of interactive computer*, at the Augmentation Research Center(ARC) at Stanford Research Institute(SRI)

Demonstrated a whole bunch of brand new things, and it was set up with different camera angles, multiple screens, live connect to a different computer and move the mouse remotely
* Mouse movement on the screen
* Copy and paste
* Collapse lines
* Basically the first word processing ever
* "I don't know why we called it a mouse, it started that way and we never did change it"
* Different fonts
* Visual diagrams
* Timesharing that allows multiple users to edit the same file at the same time - document sharing as well as time sharing

### Scientific Data Systems(SDS) 940
* Used for the mother of all demos
* Time sharing mainframe
* First will all transistors, so it was fast
* **oN-Line System Demo (NLS)**

The NLS, born from ARC at SRI, basically became what we know of as computer interaction today.

### Research Firsts
* Mouse
* Raster video monitors - show more complex info, words, natural language, *more than just lines*
* Screen windowing
* Hyptertext links between documents
* Sorting information in real time, as opposed to in the past having to run a whole new batch to get the data in a different order

### Xerox
* Purchases SDS in 1969
* Founded **PARC(Palo Alto Research Center)** in 1970

#### Xerox Alto (1973)
* Single user minicomputer
* Steve Jobs takes tour of PARC in 1979
    * They went looking for a "next thing" after the Apple II
    * IBM was going to enter the market soon (1982)
    * Alto engineers created the "desktop" metaphor with the windows - Jobs said this blew him away so much he almost missed the other awesome stuff
    * Other awesome stuff
        * Ethernet allowing easy cross-computer communication
        * Object-oriented programming with smalltalk
            * Jobs added OOP and ethernet when he made the NEXT computer after getting booted from Apple
* Alto was too expensive for marketing, it was more for research and demos

>Management-dev team interactions
>   Devs called Xerox management "toner-heads", because they were all about copiers, and couldn't see the value of the Alto

#### Commercial firsts - Xerox Star
* Ethernet
* Mouse
* Graphical user interface
* WYSIWYG document preparation systems

##### Cost
* $75,000/system (~$200,000 today)
* $16,000/computer (~$43,000 today)

The Star was so expensive because it was designed as a minicomputer, where most things are on separate chips, so you need to make them all and attach them.

## Visions of the future
* **Englebart**: collaborative, networked, timeshare (client-server) computers
* **SRI Young --> PARC**: suspicious of centralized power, personal computing

Unlike many other inventions where many different groups work and make advancements alongside each other, this was really only happening here.

Englebart's vision just didn't mesh well with the personal computer, so he kinda got left behind in history. The younger people was SRI however grew up with the protest about installing the ILLIAC, concerns about wiretapping, etc, so they didn't like single powerful machines, they wanted independence. Englebarts vision ended up being more or less how the internet works, so maybe he was just a little *too* early

## Microprocessors
* Arithmetic logic unti(ALU): +, -, &, |, etc
* Control logic unit
    * Retrieves instruction codes from memory
    * Initiates sequence of ALI operations for instruction

A Turing Machine. The microprocessor is what enabled drastic reduction in cost of computers

### Intel 4004 - 1971
**"A micro-programmable computer on a chip!"**
While not as powerful, it could theoretically do anything a mainframe can.

### Motorola 6800 - 1974
Motorola had been making electronics, saw what Intel was doing. **Chuck Peddle**, an engineer at Motorola, would go to large industrial places (Ford, Steel mills, etc) and sell the chips as embeddable.

He sells them, but realizes the price is high and volume is low. Price was $300, about $1500 today. Motorola knew it was kinda expensive, but they knew they had consistent customers that were large companies.

**Bill Mensch**, another Motorola engineer, starts thinking about what would benefit from "embedded intelligence", and comes to the conclusion that pretty much everything would.

#### Mass market approach
Bill and Chuck want to make a microprocessor with fewer features to drive down the price and make it more affordable. Chuck worked out what features could be cut for various applications. Bill and **Rod Orgdill** worked on cutting edge design and fabrication.

They make a bunch of advancement, bring it to Motorola management, and they don't like the idea, so the guys left and started a new company.

### MOS Technology 6500
* $25/chip, or $110 today
* They get sued and stuff but eventually get the product out

#### 6502: Timeless design
* System engineer: Chuck Peddle
* Seminconductor engineers: Rod Orgdill, Bill Mensch, Will Mathis
* Layout all done by hand (no CAD software then)
    * Draw, hope it works, try again if it doesn't
* 6502 apparently worked on the first attempt because Bill Mensch is a god off layout

##### Design
* Still made today, ~3 billion embedded in the whole
* Design was so good it's still used today
* Minimal instruction set
* Fast memory access
    * At the time people weren't focused on RAM access. They thought in terms of fast(how many clock cycles per second), and width(how many bits, how much data in one clock cycle)
    * RAM round trip - get info in 1 clock cycle

There was some awesome and elegant design decisions that have lasting ramifications into today.

## Personal Computer (1975-1977)
### Altair 8800 (1974)
* Built on the Intel 8080 chip
    * All design was concerning human interface, because the chip handled all the "computing"
* Known as the first PC

### IMC IMSAI 8080 (1975)
* Also built on Intel 8080

### MOS KIM-1
* A **complete microcomputer**, just plug in a keyboard and display
* $245
* Comes assembled, tested, warranteed
* Supported keyboard, display, terminal use
* 1 Kb RAM

### Apple I (1976)
* Built on the MOS 6502
* $666.66
* 8Kb RAM

### SOL-20 (late 1976)
* Built on Intel 8080
* Very expensive, seen more as a terminal than a computer

### Commodore buys MOS Technology
* Commodore wants to buy calculators, office equipment, consumer electronics
* MOS comes with all the people, including Check Peddle
    * Chuck Peddle goes to Jack Tremiel to pitch a personal computer, Jack basically says "Go for it, you can have some of the profit from sales, if it doesn't sell you're fired."

### Commodore PET (1977)
* Much more like a modern PC
* Comes all together, easy to use, all-in-one
* Powerful BASIC
* Keyboard and monitor attached

### Apple II (1977)
Wozniak saw the value in the computer as a media device
* Applications
* Graphics
* Speaker
* Modular and expandable
* Touch typing keyboard
* Built on MOS 6502

### Radio Shack TRS-80 (1977)
* Built on Zilog Z80
* Not quite as cool as the Apple II, or as powerful as the Commodore PET, but Radio Shack had the distribution channels to be competitive, already being established across the country

### IBM PC (1981)

## The rise of hackers
Hacking(as we know it now) and personal computing go hand in hand, both in development and legislature.

**You don't hack a hammer, you hack intelligence** - hacking is about manipulating intelligence, like through social engineering. If we view the CPU as embedded intelligence, then hacking is now possible on a whole new wave of things.

### Timeline
* 1977: First "computer crimes" law in House of Reps., fails to pass
    * Computers were used by Nazis, in the South African Apartheid, or secret surveillance, but when the PC is made and in the hands of the masses then we need laws
* 1978: First BBS(Bulletin Board System) - like an early forum
    * textfiles.com - a collection or old BBS files, have some Anarchist Cookbook-y type of things
    * Now more computers were connected, so people had access to other computers, and were able to try to get into stuff they weren't supposed to
* 1983: Popular culture
    * WarGames(IMSAI 8080)
    * 12+ FBI Home Raids
    * CBS's *The Whiz Kids*
    * **Newsweek** 414s - hackers on the cover
    * 6 new computer crime laws
    * View of hacking and computers was largely influenced by media
* 1984
    * 2600: The Hacker Quarterly
        * Still running today
        * Promoted and popularized the idea of hacking as problem and puzzle solving, not a criminal or savior, just someone looking for a challenge
            * "The Constitution of a Hacker"
    * Comprehensive Crime Control Act
* 1986
    * **Computer Fraud and Abuse Act**
    * Amended in 1989, 1994, 1996
    * Ammended in 2001 with the Patriot Act, 2002 and 2008
* 1987
    * Computer Security Act
        * Protects federal agencies computer databases
* 1988
    * Computer Emergency Response Team

### Embedded Intelligence
>"The microprocessor can be used to help someone understand themselves" ~ Bill Mensch

#### 6502: Timeless Design continued
* 1977: Bill Mensch leaves MOS after designing 6502
* Starts Western Design Company(WDC)
    * First "fabless" semiconductor company
        * Low startup
        * Low overhead
    * Commodore is first client
    * 1983: Steven Furber and Sophie Wilson tour WDC and realize they can do what Bill is doing to design them, but use CAD and stuff to be better
* To date: 5-10 billion embedded microprocessors

**ARM** - created by Furber and Wilson
* Fabless - just do the design for other people to build
* Small engineering teams
* Low-latency I/O
* Reduced instruction set
* Embedded applications
* Small, simple, fast, low power --> easily embeddable
* To date: 50 billion embedded microprocessors

## Discussion
**Has the PC made the world better?**

**Yes**
* Vast majority has benefited
    * gaining information access
    * contact to other people
    * software-based resources
* Parallel with literacy, we even say computer-literacy, it gives power to the individual
* Net-net: overall, while there may be negatives, the benefits far outweigh them
* Embedded intelligence, make things more efficiently
* Analogy to literacy - pretty much everything still fits, and we know with centuries of evidence that literacy is good for society

**No**
* Higher crime - spread of child pron, hacking, identity theft
* Youth is more vulnerable to ideas, and is now exposed to more earlier on
* Information != Wisdom/knowledge, just more information, just as likely to mislead you as is it to educate you

**Neither**
* Technology is just a multiplier for what we already do


I'm using this for yes but I guess it could be bad, but if you switch PC for literacy everything still fits well, and literacy seems good.
