# Cyberlibertarianism

## Part 1

### Mid-20th century attitudes

**Computers are:**

-   Obtuse batch processing machines
-   Benefiting the rich and powerful
-   For bureaucrats
-   Used for war

### 1950s and 1960s - AI Lab at MIT

**The MIT Hacker**

> "Hacker" is an MIT term from before computers, started with their model railroad club that used the term for clever train switching systems

Had a resource limitation, wanted to:
1. Get machine access - not many machines at all
2. Make something better

MIT got a TX-0 mainframe computer, and "hacks" were created to explore the capabilities of the machine. The "expensive typewriter" was a word processing program, it did the same thing as a typewriter but using mainframe time, which costs a fair amount.

#### Projects

Two problems getting in the way of AI with batch processing

-   Interactive computing
-   Time sharing

##### Interactive computing

Lisp by John McCarthy

-   The second language after FORTRAN
-   Still used a lot today, especially in AI
-   Designed differently than FORTRAN
    -   FORTRAN = Formula Translator - give it formulas and a bunch of data, get an answer. With intelligence you don't have the whole problem defined up front.
    -   Used a _Linked List_ as a major data structure - this added the power to work with the details without worrying about the whole scope of the problem. LISP = LISt Processor
    -   Added a **REPL**(Read Evaluate Print Loop) to make it interactive

##### Time sharing

> "What the user wants is a computer that he can have continuusly at his beck and call for long periods of time." ~John McCarthy, founder of the AI lab

-   IBM 704 with an _interrupt system_ - needed for interactivity and timesharing
-   _Flexowriter_ - built for punching paper tape - used for input and output to Lisp machine
-   Timesharing and Lisp debut the same day
    1.  `THE GARBAGE COLLECTOR HAS BEEN CALLED` - machine runs out of memory
    2.  `SOME INTERESTING STATISTICS ARE AS FOLLOWS...` - a second program batch job demonstrates multiple programs running on one computer - a first

###### Timesharing issues for hackers

-   Security - you can't see all the files on the computer anymore!
-   Central control - other people can administrate the computer than the user

#### Hacker ethic

##### Hand-on imperative

People should know how systems work in depth so they can modify or improve it. Information should be available so anyone can help improve it.

-   Telephone networks
-   Model trains
-   Computers

##### No locked doors

-   Access to information and tools
-   Locks are symbols of bureaucracy

> Lots of break-ins at MIT at the time. Hackers would try to get into security programs to disable them.

##### Mistrust authority

Mutually exclusive

-   _Hackers:_ logical algorithms, constructive exploration
-   _Bureaucrats:_ arbitrary rules, consolidate power

A bureaucrats survival depends on keeping people ignorant

> The hacker ethos says that algorithms are logical and unbiased, but can be used for biased actions. This is an interesting debate, but it seems like technology and algorithms are imbued with the intentions and ideas of the creators and the culture.

##### Computers can improve lives (when in the hands of the individual, not bureaucrats)

-   Reward inquisitiveness - feedback mechanism
-   Individually empowering
-   Frictionless sharing
-   Engender creation and collaboration

### Spread of the hacker ethic

-   **AI Lab MIT --> Stanford**, John McCarthy moves and brings the culture
-   **Interactive computing --> minicomputers**, Digital Equipment Corporation
-   **Timesharing --> ARPANET**, labs across the country communicate easily

### 1970s - California

Poem - _All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace_ by Richard Brautigan in 1967

#### Loving Grace Cybernetics

Lee Felsenstein - **Community Memory and Pennywhistle Modem**

-   A teletype at Leopold's Records in Berkeley CA
-   SDS 940 mainframe in San Francisco
    -   The 940 was the first really reliable robust mainframe - sparked the ideas for reliable smaller and personal computers
-   First public computer BBS(Bulletin Board Service) - basically Craigslist
-   Ivan Illich's _Tools for Conviviality_ influence
    -   Technocratic elites control basic means
    -   Give people tools that guarantee their right to work with independent efficiency

#### People's Computer Company

Organization and Newsletter - wants to empower used with computers to take power away from bureaucrats

Becomes **Dr. Dobbs Journal of Computer Calisthenics & Orthodontia**

-   1976 - 2014
-   Distributed code for
    -   Tiny BASIC
        -   Leftist thought in design - boots up with `@COPYLEFT - ALL WRONGS RESERVED`
    -   Apple 6502 display codes
    -   ...and more

#### Software

_Software should be free, information should be free_ - Apple ideology

Bill Gates writes _An Open Letter to Hobbyists_ saying that people need to pay for software if they want good software, arguing against the hacker idea that hardware costs money but software is free.

> **1977 - the birth of the PC - KNOW FOR FINAL**
> **1977 "Holy Trinity" - Apple II, TRS 80, Commodore PET**

## Documentary - *All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace* - Episode 1 - Love and Power
**Ayn Rand** - Objectivism inspired by Aristotle and apparently otherwise uninfluenced. Writes *The Fontainhead* to express her philosophy that you need to prioritize your own rational self-interest.

*Atlas Shrugged* becomes the second best-selling book in the US after the bible, and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs embraced it deeply.

Computers became seen as a way for individuals to have way more freedom and agency over their own lives. *"The world would be stabile, yet everone would be free to follow their Randian desires".*

The **California Ideology** involved individual power through freedom, where *the government facilitates rather than administrates.*

**Bill Clinton** wanted to make new programs to help America, *Alan Greenspan*(who was friends with Ayn Rand and heavily influenced by her) told him any more borrowing would raise interests rates and mess up the economy, instead suggesting *cutting government spending and letting the market have more power.*

*December 1996* - Greenspan warns that the economy might be overvalued, in some part of a speculation bubble, after seeing increased profits without increased production. After political pressure, Greenspan says he was wrong, and goes to tell Clinton that *widespread computer usage has created a totally different economy.* Computers helped the economy pretty easily, and the government didn't have to really do anything.

Ayn Rand fell in love with another member of her "collective" that made up her close (and after criticism only) close friends. She viewed all of her actions as reasonable, and came to the conclusion that Richard Branden should have an affair with her(also married), even though he was married to her other friend Barbara Weidman. Barbara ultimately agreed to it, in order to help Rand find romantic happiness.

The new computer-fueled economy grew in America under Clinton, and also spread to Asia improving their economy. This however formed a property development bubble, that eventually burst causing Western investors from the US to withdraw funding. The IMF(International Monetary Fund) agreed to loans for stabilizing the Asian economies as long as they made their economies more Western, which was cited as the reason the investments didn't work the first time. These loans were used to pay back investors that wanted to get money out of the countries, only making the problems worse, adding debt to the country without helping the economy at all. In 2 months unemployment jumped 15%.

Bill Clinton tried to give more power to the people by enabling the market, but just ended up giving more power to financiers, who then abused this power, ruining the lives of millions of people through economic destruction.

**9/11** hits, and everyone thought it would ruin the new awesome system that had been going on. Alan Greenspan basically saved the whole thing and brough it back to normal by repeatedly cutting interest rates to help consumers. Usually this causes massive inflation, but it didn't this time. *All seemed well, but in there was an issue with companies faking numbers in collusion with large financial institutions.*

Asian countries decided not to let themselves be at the will of American finance again. They created a lot of cheap goods to send to America, and used the revenues to buy US bonds. This created a lot of the perceived stability in the US economy. *US financiers didn't see this, because they believed computers were creating the stability through intelligent hedging of bets to mitigate risk.*

Then **The Financial Crisis of 2008** hit, where the fake strength of the economy was shown to be fake. The big financial institutions asked for a bailout from the government to preserve power and got it.
