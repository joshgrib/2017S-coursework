# Final Overview

## Readings - any we had quizzes on
* NSA Frontline
* Wasting Time on the Internet - Meme Machine
* Wasting Time on the Internet - Let's Get Lost)
* Computers as Ethical Artifacts
* Computers as a Communication Device
* Englebart AI

## Themes, Computers, People - keys for contextualizing
Overarching:
* Between shifts in themes there's always some resistance because generally the people using the older technology don't feel that they need the new stuff
* IBM has been good at pivoting in large ways to keep up with changing trends

### Prehistory
* **Claude Shannon** - information theory
* **Alan Turing** - Turing machine
* **Punch cards** - IBM did this before mainframes

### Mainframe

>Theme: batch processing

* **IBM**
  * System/360
* Sperry Rand
* Burroughs - ILLIAC IV protested at University of Illinois
  * Mainframes are tools for war, PCs are tools for personal empowerment
  * Stuart Brand -> Jack Tramiel -> PET
    * Brand - in long Spacewar reading
* **ENIAC**(1946)
* **UNIVAC**(1951) - first commercial computer

### Mini computer

>Theme: interactive computing

* **DEC**
  * PDP-1
  * PDP-8
  * PDP-11

### Personal computer

> Theme: democratization

* **The trinity - 1977**
  * Commodore PET
    * Jack Tramiel
  * Apple II
  * Radioshack TRS-80
* **IBM PC**(1981)
* **Hacking culture**
  * **Nolan Bushnell**(Atari) - main source of Silicon Valley culture
* Commodore 64(1982) - Computers for the masses - plug and play - Jack Tramiel
  * PCs came from calculators not minicomputers, focussing on the democratization
* 6502 Microprocessor enables PC revolution
* Spawns cultures of hacking(MIT AI Lab), cyberlibertarianism, FOSS, and art

### Networked computer

>Theme: communication device

* **ARPANET**(1969) - predecessor to the modern internet
* Media - distribution, as a commodity, zero merginal costs

## Week overview
### Week 1
Atari - culture
Jack tramiel

ARPA initial fundind by Eisenhower - also warned of Military Industrial Complex

### Week 2
Mainframes get bigger - intended for large organizations, bureaucrats
Batch processing - not general purpose machines
IBM Punchcards help with census
SAGE system - early networked computers for bomber defense
* SAGE is useless by the time it's finished because missiles are developed, but it's used for air traffic control
IBM and the 7 draves

### Week 4
NSA's objectives are signals intelligence and information assurance
Spying is more powerful with computers
NSA contributed a lot to the advancement of computers
Different landmark advancements
Cryptography

### Week 5
Commoditization of media
Thoery of media - Marshall McLuhan
Foundations of computing - math cncepts, information theory Claude Shannon
*A Mathematical Theory of Communication*(1941) - introduced idea of a bit
Turing's big in 1936 - if a human can solve a problem algorithmically, a computer can do it too
Konrad Zuse - made big advances in Germany that didn't go far because of the war

### Week 6
Computer history
DEC
PDP-1(1959) and Spacewars(1962)
IBM Stretch - used by NSA for mass-spying

### Week 7
Jack Tramiel
International computing

### Week 8
**The Mother of All Demos** - Doug Englebart - oNLine System(NLS)
  * NLS from Augmented Research Center(ARC) at Stanford Research Institute(SRI)
* Englebart -> Xerox Alto -> Macintosh
* Microprocessor - 6502
