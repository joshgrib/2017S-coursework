Last week of class

Final next week
* Short answer and some multiple choice

# Computers and Art
## Part 1: Generative Art

Computers and code are good at logic, with clear quantitative applications

Quantitative reasoning
* **Hard:** mathematically provable
  * Correctness
  * Performance
* **Soft:** cogitating(thinking about it)
  * Behavior
  * Improvements

Code also has a history in abstract domains, with focus on aesthetics and story instead of just straight numbers

**Art**(for this discussion) is anything that has a purpose other than utility. Art = value - utility

Artists are mostly qualitative, with two main modes:
* Chaos and surrender (Pollock)
* Decisiveness and agency (Pointillism)

The *decisive artist* - you have to know the rules to be able to make decisions that break them (E.e. Cummings), otherwise it's just randomness

The *decisive programmer* has to know the rules before they can write them.

But **we don't always know the rules**, and hence, **generative art**

### AARON
Harold Cohen developed this painting program over decades

COlor ended up being one of the hardest problems

Define every decision condition in advance, OR, make a small number of primitives and build off that

### ZORK
Developed at MIT (1975-1982) on a PDP

Text manipulation in the game, you just write what you want to do with natural language
* Initially only "<verb> <noun>" communication - "open mailbox"
* Later, direct and indirect objects - "fill the bottle with water"
  * Parsing and language - also built up from a small number of primitives

### Qualitative reasoning
* Unknown quantities
* Exploration of the idea

## Part 2: Computer Art
**Computer art** is a creative misuse of the technology, often unlocking a hidden potential. Additionally computer can democratize production and reception of artwork

**Spacewar - know for the final, 1962 @ MIT**
Before spacewar - [Minskytron](http://www.masswerk.at/minskytron/) was a program that someone at MIT wrote to make some random arty designs on the same computer used for Spacewar

### Ivan Sutherland
* *Sketchpad*(MIT 1962) - orecursor to Douglas Englebart's NLS
  * Oscilloscope with computer and "light pen", that was an early interactive CAD system
* ARPA Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO 1964)
* *The Sword of Damocles*(Harvard 1968) - first head-mounted VR/AR
* University of Utah -> Frank Crow(student of Sutherland -> cofounder of Pixar, President of Disney)
* Mentor for doctoral thesis was Claude Shannon

**For final - know "Ivan Sutherland = Sketchpad"**

### John WHitney
* *Matrix*(CALTECH/IBM 1970)
* *Arabesque*(UCLA 1975)

### Kenneth C  Knowlton
* BELFIX(Bell Labs 1970) - for working with bitmap images, as opposed to vector displays on oscilloscopes

### Telematic art
Medium: Computer mediated telecommunications networks
Outcome: remote aesthetic encounters

**The Poietic Generator**
Olivier Auber 1986
On the French Minitel network
People on the network could all place a pixel - the origin of /r/place

**The Max Headtoom Incident**(1987)
Chicago - signal for TV station taken over and replaced with video and sound of guy in a mask
Still nobody knows who did it

**NCSA Mosaic**(1993)
First big internet browser, eventually replaced by Netscape

### The browser wars
Netscape VS Internet Explorer

Bill Gates saw the internet as a threat to their business model, so they made Internet Explorer and purposely made it incompatible with Netscape so people had to decide what browser they wanted their website to support. IE won out, but created a fracturing web where developers have to support various browsers.
