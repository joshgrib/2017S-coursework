# Mainframes
---
**Mentioned for importance**
* IBM 360 - the compatible computer
* Mainframes are synonymous with Military applications
---
**Second generation: late 1950s**
Vacuum tube ==> Transistor

**1970s/1980s hierarchy**
1. Supercomputer
2. Mainframes - IBM
3. Mini computer - DEC
4. Micro computer (PC) - HP

Mainframes carry the significance of only really being available to big entities. There's a certain privilege to being able to use a mainframe because of the barrier of entry with the cost of ownership and operation in both money and space. **This means to use a mainframe a company needs a lot of resources, and the proper structure and use and maintain it properly.**

Vacuum tubes are pretty large and also unreliable(maybe even around 70% uptime). Transistors changed this by being both very small and reliable.

>With some forms of power (windmill, burning wood) anyone can do it on their own. With something with nuclear power we have to kinda agree to hand over power to someone else and rely on them to have access to the technology. Mainframes were similar in this way that there's no way anyone can easily have access to it.

## Two kinds of computing
### Business
* Sell hundreds of mainframes(selling a couple hundred would be a big success)
* Compatibility
* Ease of use
* Cost
* Features
* Sales team (e.g. IBM)
> **IBM side note:** the oldest computing company, automated census work for the government in the 1890s. They spent a lot of money of technology, but also on the sales team and culture. **I**ternational **B**usiness **M**achines

A **business batch job** would commonly have large I/O with simple computing. They had a decimal design (not binary) to better accomodate dollars and cents and the applications it would be used for more

### Scientific
* Sell just a few(IBM Stretch had 5 made and 4 sold, and was a success)
* Speed and application-specific design
* Bidding team looking for government contracts

A **scientific batch job** was have a small I/O with complex computations, using a binary design. As an example you could input details about atoms and try to calculate the nuclear reaction between them

**Scientific applications**
* Private research
* Government research
* Military applications
    * Cryptography (the purpose of the NSA)
    * Aerospace monitoring
    * Ballistics modeling (ENIAC created for this)
    * Nuclear weapons development

## Politics and the Military
There was an embargo against selling computers to the Soviet Union because they were so powerful and dangerous.

### "IBM and the Seven Dwarfs"

#### IBM
* Punch cards - census and social security
    * Your social security number is a number made by IBM to track how much money people make set aside money for retirements. The system is totally centralized in Virginia
* IBM 704 - Air Force (SAGE: Semi-Automatic Ground Environment)
    * The most expensive and largest computer in the history of mankind
    * We used to have to check radars, compare to flight plans, and manually track locations on big boards.
    * Designed at MIT Lincoln Lab
    * You could point a little gun (a la Duck Hunt) at the dots on the screen to get more info
    * SAGE installations were strategically placed across the country with a few in each NORAD division
    * Because of the unreliability of vacuum tubes, each installation had two systems on two separate floor. Additionally they were all connected to communicate
    * So complex that wiring had to happen manually
    * By the time SAGE was finished weaponry had advanced to make it pretty much useless, but we advanced technology A LOT - networking, critical uptime, better interface
* IBM System/360 - NSA (Problem Lightning - architecture still in use today)
    * IBM started to realize that making all one-off computers incompatible with each other meant all software had to be rewritten. **The 360 marked the beginning of making compatibility important.** This meant they had to outdate all current machines and basically replace them all, and they had **2/3 of the market share**.
        > something similar happened when Apple made the iPhone and made the iPod much less useful, cannibalizing their most successful product. IBM's jump was a way bigger deal

    * They guessed it was take 5 Billion to develop, and their revenue in 1962 was 2.5B, so it was a bet on the company

**Most of the time these things were developed for a military application in the Cold War context, and then they were adapted for commercial use.**

**IBM** in Poughkeepsie NY

#### 1. Sperry Rand
* ENIAC (1946) - Army ballistics tables creation
    * Used to be done manually by a lot of women just doing the math all day
* UNIVAC (1951)
    * Scared IBM by being synonymous with "computer" with Kleenex and tissues today
    * **In the 1950s most people got the election prediction for Eisenhower wrong, but the UNIVAC got it right**, also culturally establishing what a mainframe was
* UNIVAC 1100 series (1962) - Navy M-460, AKA AN/USQ-17, architecture still in use today

"Rand" came from Remington-Rand who made typewriters and then guns

#### 2. Burroughs
* B-5000 (1961) - still used architecture today
* D825 (1962) - Navy/NSA - Multiprocessor
* ILLIAC IV (1971) - DARPA - Massively parallel

#### 3. NCR
Cryptography

#### 4. RCA
Spectra 70 - Air Force (SAGE)

#### 5. Honeywell
Cluster bombs and missile guidance systes

#### 6. Control Data Corporation
Supercomputer company
Seymore Cray worked here and also started Cray Computers, and together these companies established the supercomputer market

#### 7. General Electric
Multics - ARPA funded project MAC (1961)
The root of all Unix systems
