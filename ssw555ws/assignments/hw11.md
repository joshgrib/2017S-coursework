The Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) describes goals and plans at several levels of abstraction:
* Investment Themes
* Epics
* Features
* Stories
* Tasks

Describe examples of each of these for a company like MyHeritage that produces software and services for genealogy research. That is, give specific examples of themes, epics, features, stories and tasks that might be used in planning and developing software that allows users to record and analyze their family trees.
* Investment Theme - Users can handle all geneology data in one place
* Epic - User has full online management of geneology data
* Feature - User can upload and edit gedcom files online
* Story - A user should be alerted for the error of duplicate IDs in a file
* Task - Find duplicate IDs in input file

Start with at the portfolio level and identify one or two new strategic areas that MyHeritage might pursue to enhance their product to give them a strategic advantage in the market.  Then drill down through those themes to epics, features, stories, and tasks.

Great user interface
* Epic - Online visual management center
* Feature - Visual editor

Assisted tree creation
* Epic - Help users expand their family tree
